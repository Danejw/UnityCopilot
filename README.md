UnityCopilot is an AI-powered chat interface for the Unity Editor. It is designed to assist game developers in building their games in Unity.

Project Description
UnityCopilot is an AI-powered tool designed to assist game developers in building their games in Unity. It integrates OpenAI's GPT-4 model directly into the Unity editor, providing a chat interface that allows developers to get help with various aspects of game development.

The tool includes the following features:

Chat Interface: Communicate with the AI assistant using a convenient chat window right within the Unity editor. Ask questions, request code snippets, or discuss game design concepts. The tool supports different types of assistants, such as a programmer, story designer, character designer, and environment designer.

Context-Aware Assistance: UnityCopilot can understand and provide context-aware assistance based on your project's scripts and assets. Drag and drop C# scripts into the chat window to provide context for your questions.

Error Handling: UnityCopilot can read error logs and help debug issues in your code. When in debug mode, the tool includes the latest error message in the conversation with the AI assistant, allowing for more focused assistance.

Settings and Customization: Customize the tool to your liking, from choosing your preferred AI endpoint to selecting the appearance of the chat interface.

UnityCopilot aims to make game development in Unity more efficient and enjoyable, helping developers overcome roadblocks and learn new concepts through interactive dialogue with an AI assistant.

Note: UnityCopilot uses the OpenAI models, which may require an API key and can incur costs based on usage. Please refer to OpenAI's pricing details for more information.
